# "Where there is a shell, There is a way"

### Hey üëã,

My name is **Noam Alum**, I'm an *Automation Specialist* at [JetApps](https://www.jetapps.com/), and I have been a member of the [AlmaLinux foundation](https://almalinux.org/) for the better part of a year now.

Back in my first year of high school I never imagined I'd be into **Linux**, **networking**, or **programming** (etc), but when I asked my dad for a job at his office he didn‚Äôt just give me a simple job like cleaning up; instead, he handed me a stack of papers with a challenge ‚Äî complete these tasks and you‚Äôre hired!

<Note type="note">
  if I recal right it was creating a **LAMP server** and installing [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) on it.
</Note>

At the time, he was running a web hosting company named **JetServer**, and Linux became a huge part of my learning curve, work, and eventually my life. Among all the distributions I‚Äôve encountered, **AlmaLinux** stands out, It's the first Linux distro I ever used and it holds a special place in my heart.

### What now?

Fast forward to today, I‚Äôve had the privilege of working in the tech industry for several years, I spent nearly **4 years** at [JetServer Cloud LTD](https://jetserver.co.il/) as a *System Administrator* where I found myself creating a lot of **bash scripts** to automate and streamline my daily tasks, over time, I became highly proficient in scripting, and this skill became a cornerstone of my career.

Now, as an *Automation Specialist* at **JetApps**, I focus on automating **CI/CD pipelines** and **QA testing** for [JetBackup 5](https://www.jetbackup.com/), ensuring smooth and efficient software releases.

In addition to my work at JetApps, I‚Äôm also continuing my education in **ICT** and **Networking** at college, supported by the **IDF**. I‚Äôm currently involved in a networking project with them, further expanding my technical knowledge and skills. For the past year, I‚Äôve also been a proud member of the **AlmaLinux Foundation**, where I contribute to the community and collaborate on open-source initiatives.
