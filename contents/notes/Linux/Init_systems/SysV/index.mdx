# SysV (System V) Overview

SysV, short for System V, is one of the first versions of the UNIX operating system, originally developed by AT&T. Released in the early 1980s, it became a standard for many commercial UNIX systems. SysV introduced several important features that are still used in UNIX-like operating systems today, including in **Red Hat** and **Debian** distributions.

## Run Levels in SysV

### Red Hat 7 Stages

- **0** - Shutdown
- **1** - Single user mode (recovery)
- **2** - Multi user without networking
- **3** - Multi user with networking
- **4** - To be customized by the admin
- **5** - Multi user with networking and graphics
- **6** - Reboot

### Debian Stages

- **0** - Shutdown
- **1** - Single user mode (recovery)
- **2** - Multi user with networking and graphics
- **6** - Reboot

## Managing Services

Services in Red Hat distributions can be found in the `/etc/init.d` directory. 

To switch between stages, you can use the `init {stage number}` command. You can also use `telinit` or `runlevel` commands to see the current run level of your system.

## Powering Off the Machine

We have several commands for restarting and powering off the system:

- **`reboot`**: Stops all processes, shuts down the system, and then immediately starts it back up.
- **`halt`**: Brings the system to a complete halt. Depending on the implementation, it might also power off the system.
- **`poweroff`**: Stops all processes, unmounts all filesystems, and then turns off the power to the system. This is similar to `halt`, but `poweroff` specifically ensures that the system's power is turned off.
- **`shutdown`**: Turns off the system. You can use the `-r` parameter to schedule a shutdown in minutes, and you can also add a message to all users.

## More Commands and Paths

- **`wall`**: Sends a message to all logged users.
- **`/etc/issue`**: You can use this file to show users alerts before entering the system.
- **`/etc/motd`**: You can use this file to show users alerts after entering the system.
- **`mesg`**: Shows the status of your receiving messages. If it’s `n`, you are not receiving any messages. If it’s `y`, you are. You can change it by typing those parameters.
