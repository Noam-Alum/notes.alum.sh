# Shell scripting

Like a movie script we can *script* the actions we want to use on a shell, most Linux operating systems uses bash as the shell used by its users.
You can check your shell by running the `echo "$SHELL"` command or by opening the "/etc/passwd" file.

> A shell is a type of computer program called a command-line interpreter.

Each shell script has a posfix of **.sh**, has to start with **#!** + **Path to shell** (For example /bin/bash), and has to have an executable premission.

- Comments: to comment in a bash script we use **#**.

For example:
```sh
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello"
sleep 3
echo "Bye"
```

## Variables

To declare a variable we use the following syntax:
```sh 
#!/bin/bash

# declare a name variable
name="Noam"

# use the name variable
echo "my name is $name"
```

---

On linux mechines we have **system Variables**, the OS uses them for its purposes.
To check some of the **system variables** (eviorment variables) we can use the `printenv` command.
```bash
printenv
```

> For a list of common system variables refer [here](page.php?page=docs/Linux/Shell_scripting/system_variables.md).

## User input

To get user input its gennraly accepted to use the read binary, read allows you to read from stdin and store the data in a variable.

```sh 
#!/bin/bash

read -p "What is your name: " name

echo "My name is $name"
```

## Conditions

Here are the gennral compersion operators for bash:

| Operator | Description             | Example                   |
|----------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| -eq      | is equal to             | if [ "$a" -eq "$b" ]     |
| -ne      | is not equal to         | if [ "$a" -ne "$b" ]     |
| -gt      | is greater than         | if [ "$a" -gt "$b" ]     |
| -ge      | is greater than or equal| if [ "$a" -ge "$b" ]     |
| -lt      | is less than            | if [ "$a" -lt "$b" ]     |
| -le      | is less than or equal   | if [ "$a" -le "$b" ]     |
| \<        | is less than            | (("$a" \< "$b"))          |
| \<=       | is less than or equal   | (("$a" \<= "$b"))         |
| \>        | is greater than         | (("$a" \> "$b"))          |
| \>=       | is greater than or equal| (("$a" \>= "$b"))         |

We can use conditions in bash to make better dynamicly adapting scripts.

- if:
    ```sh 
    #!/bin/bash
    
    # Get age
    read -p "What is your age? " age

    # Check if age is over 18
    if [ $age -gt 18 ]; then
        echo "The age is greater than 18"
    fi
    ```

- else:
    ```sh 
    #!/bin/bash
    
    # Get age
    read -p "What is your age? " age

    # Check if age is over 18
    if [ $age -gt 18 ]; then 
        echo "The age is greater than 18" 
    else
        echo "The age is lower than 18"
    fi
    ```

- elif:
    ```sh 
    #!/bin/bash
    
    # Get age
    read -p "What is your age? " age

    # Check if age is over 18
    if [ $age -gt 18 ]; then 
        echo "The age is greater than 18"
    elif [ $age -eq 18 ]; then
        echo "The age is 18"
    else
        echo "The age is lower than 18"
    fi
    ```

## Loops

- while:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    name="noam"
    i=0

    while [ "$name" == "noam" ]; then
        i++;

        if [ i -gt 3 ]; then
            name="shay"
        fi
    done
    ```

- for:
   - range
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash

        start=1
        end=5

        for i in $(seq $start $end)
        do
            echo "$i"
        done
        ```
    - objects
        ```bash
        #!/bin/bash

        names="noam shay eli"

        for name in $names
        do
            echo "Hello $name"
        done
        ```
- case:
    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    read -p "What is your name? : " name

    case $name in

    noam)
        echo "Hello noam"
    ;;

    shay)
        echo "hello shay"
    ;;

    eli)
        echo "hello eli"
    ;;

    *)
        echo "Unknown name"
    ;;

    esac
    ```

## Special operations



**Sub shell:**

A `sub shell` is when we create a shell child proccess from within another shell.
We can achive that with two main ways:


1. ```bash
    echo "$(ls -al)"
    ```
2. ```bash
    echo "`ls -al`"
    ```



**Output redirection**

In linux we can redirect the output of a given command by using the `>` charecter.

- `>` - overwrite
- `>>` - append

> Redirecting to `/dev/null` would "get rid" of the output, and not save it.

We can choose wheter to redirect `stdout` or `stderr` by specefing a given number:

- **1** - stdout
- **2** - stderr

For example:
```bash
echo "hello" > /dev/null
cat doesntexist.txt 2> /dev/null
```

> You can use `&` to redirect both 1 and 2 (stdout and stderr).



**Status codes:**

Every program or command in Linux (or in gennral) should return a **status code** when it exists.

We can check the status code of the last command used in Linux by checking the value of `$?`.
For example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

cat test.txt &> /dev/null

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "File opened"
else
    echo "Error! status code $?"
fi
```
