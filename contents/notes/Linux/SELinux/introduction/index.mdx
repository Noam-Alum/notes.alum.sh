# SELinux

Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a security architecture for LinuxÂ® systems that allows administrators to have more control over who can access the system.

> SELinux was originally a development project from the National Security Agency (NSA) and originally implemented as a loadable kernel module for Linux kernel v2.4.

SELinux provides more control to a system administrator over the default DAC aproach (Discretionary Access Control), when an application or process, known as a subject, makes a request to access an object, like a file, SELinux checks with an access vector cache (AVC), where permissions are cached for subjects and objects.

| Description                    | Name     | Can be             |
|--------------------------------|----------|--------------------|
| processes                      | subjects | Trusted, Untrusted |
| system resources such as files | objects  | Trusted, Untrusted |

## Policy

The SELinux policy uses these contexts in a series of rules which define how processes can interact with each other and the various system resources. By default, the policy does not allow any interaction unless a rule explicitly grants access.

>  SELinux policy rules are checked after DAC rules.

Configuration file structure:

| #              | Syntax                                  | Example  |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|----------|
| User           | &lt;username&gt;\_u                     | system_u |
| Role           | &lt;name&gt;\_r                         | object_r |
| Type           | &lt;name&gt;\_t                         | httpd_t  |
| Range          | s&lt;N&gt; or s&lt;sN&gt; - s&lt;eN&gt; | s0 - s15 |

```text
user_u:role_r:type_t:level
```

**For example:**
```text
unconfined_u:object_r:user_home_t:s0
```

> *NIX may **NEVER** be user_u with the system_u user in SELinux.

### Usefull commands:

- `ls -laZ`
- `ps -Z`
