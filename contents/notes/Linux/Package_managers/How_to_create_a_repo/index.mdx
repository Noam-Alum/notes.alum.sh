# How to create a repo on RHEL based systems

> On *RHEL based systems* packages are called RPMs (**R**ed Hat **P**ackage **M**anager).

RPM repository is a collection of RPM packages, metadata, and configuration files hosted on a server for easy installation and management on RPM-based Linux systems.

---

To create a repo we need a webserver (I assume you have one running) and to use the `createrepo_c` command.

> If not installed run `dnf install createrepo_c`.

### Creating the repository

For the sake of this experiment I created a `VirtualHost` with a `DocumentRoot` that points to `/home/repotest/public_html/` and well focus on adding a package on `AlmaLinux`, `8`, `x86_64` named `noam-1.19.5-11.el8.x86_64.rpm`.

The stracture of a repo in general is as follows:

| Directory (Path)                 | Purpose and Usage                                                                                   |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `[DOCUMENTROOT]/[DISTRO]/`       | Root directory for the RPM repository structure, replace `[DISTRO]` with your distribution name.    |
| `[DOCUMENTROOT]/[DISTRO]/releases/` | Directory for organizing releases of the distribution (e.g., `33`, `8`, `7`).                       |
| `[DOCUMENTROOT]/[DISTRO]/releases/[RELEASE]/` | Specific release version directory (e.g., `33` for Fedora 33).                                   |
| `[DOCUMENTROOT]/[DISTRO]/releases/[RELEASE]/[ARCHITECTURE]/` | Architecture-specific directory (e.g., `x86_64` for 64-bit x86 architecture).           |
| `[DOCUMENTROOT]/[DISTRO]/updates/` | Directory for updates related to the distribution.                                                 |
| `[DOCUMENTROOT]/[DISTRO]/updates/[RELEASE]/` | Updates specific to a release version (e.g., `33`).                                                |
| `[DOCUMENTROOT]/[DISTRO]/updates/testing/` | Optional: Directory for testing or pre-release updates.                                             |
| `[DOCUMENTROOT]/[DISTRO]/updates/testing/[RELEASE]/` | Testing updates specific to a release version (e.g., `33`).                                      |
| `[DOCUMENTROOT]/[DISTRO]/updates/testing/[RELEASE]/[ARCHITECTURE]/` | Testing updates for a specific architecture on a release version.                      |
| `[DOCUMENTROOT]/[DISTRO]/keys/`   | Directory for storing GPG keys used to sign repository metadata and packages for verification.      |
| `[DOCUMENTROOT]/[DISTRO]/README`  | Optional: README file providing information about the repository, its usage, and instructions.      |
| `[DOCUMENTROOT]/[DISTRO]/releases/[RELEASE]/[ARCHITECTURE]/repodata/` | Directory containing repository metadata (`repomd.xml`, `primary.xml.gz`, etc.).                   |

> Notes:
> - `[DOCUMENTROOT]`: Replace with the actual path configured as `DocumentRoot` in your web server's virtual host configuration.
> - `[DISTRO]`, `[RELEASE]`, `[ARCHITECTURE]`: Placeholders for distribution name, release version, and architecture names.

So The directory tree would look this:

> Using `el` in repository structures provides a standardized and recognizable identifier for distributions based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), ensuring clear organization and easy identification across systems and repositories.

```text
public_html/
└── el
    ├── keys
    ├── README
    └── releases
        └── 8
            └── x86_64
                └── noam-1.19.5-11.el8.x86_64.rpm
```

Since we dont need the `updates` directory I did not include it.

### Adding GPG validation

First install `gnupg2` and `rpm-sign` by running:

```bash
sudo dnf install gnupg2 rpm-sign
```

> - **GnuPG2** is a command-line tool and library for encryption and digital signature operations, providing secure communication and data integrity verification.
> - **rpm-sign** is a command-line tool used in RPM-based Linux distributions to sign RPM packages with cryptographic signatures, ensuring authenticity and integrity verification during installation.

To achieve your goal of hosting the GPG key on your repository and configuring your repository file (`*.repo`) to use `gpgkey=URL` to pull it, here's a step-by-step guide. This assumes you have an RPM package (`my-package.rpm`) that you want to sign with your GPG key and make available in your repository.

##### Step 1: Generate and Export GPG Key

First, follow the steps to generate and export your GPG key as outlined earlier:

1. **Generate a GPG Key Pair**:
   ```bash
   gpg --full-generate-key
   ```
   Take note of the GPG key ID (`[key ID]`).

2. **Export the GPG Public Key**:
   ```bash
   gpg --export --armor [key ID] > public.key
   ```
   This creates `public.key` containing your GPG public key.

3. **Move the Public Key to Repository Directory**:
   Place `public.key` in the directory where your repository is hosted (`/home/repotest/public_html/el/keys`).

4. **Add to RPM macro file:**
	in the file `/etc/rpm/macros` add the following line:
	```text
	%_gpg_name [key ID]
	```
	You can check the [key ID] using `gpg --list-keys`

##### Step 2: Sign Your RPM Package

Sign your RPM package (`noam-1.19.5-11.el8.x86_64.rpm`) with your GPG private key:

```bash
rpm --addsign noam-1.19.5-11.el8.x86_64.rpm
```
This signs the RPM package using your GPG private key.

Note that we are missing a very imprtant directory, the **repodata** directory, it is created via the `createrepo_c` tool:

> **createrepo_c** is a command-line tool for creating and managing YUM repositories on Red Hat-based Linux distributions by generating repository metadata from RPM packages.

```bash
[root@server x86_64]# createrepo_c /home/repotest/public_html/el/releases/8/x86_64/
Directory walk started
Directory walk done - 1 packages
Temporary output repo path: /home/repotest/public_html/el/releases/8/x86_64/.repodata/
Preparing sqlite DBs
Pool started (with 5 workers)
Pool finished
```

Now the directory tree looks like this:

```bash
public_html/
└── el
    ├── keys
    │   └── public.key
    ├── README
    └── releases
        └── 8
            └── x86_64
                ├── noam-1.19.5-11.el8.x86_64.rpm
                └── repodata
                    ├── 0d0b5898877f2da27d3ba9be4a52d1147da40b8ba04a009ec7542dd81f67d60d-primary.sqlite.bz2

                    └── repomd.xml
```

Great! we successfully created a repo from scratch :)

### Creating a repo file (client side)

We have a deep-dive explenation on this subject [here](page.php?page=docs/Linux/Package_managers/package_managers.md), so I'll just supply the file contents for this to work in this section:
- **File path:** `/etc/yum.repos.d/`
- **File name:** *noams-packages.repo*

**Contents:**
```text
[Noam]
name=Noam
baseurl=https://learnings.alum.sh/HTML/repo/public_html/el/releases/$releasever/$basearch/
enabled=1
gpgkey=https://learnings.alum.sh/HTML/repo/public_html/el/keys/public.key
gpgcheck=1
```
