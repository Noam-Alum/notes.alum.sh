# After transfer

## Swap IP addresses

1. Change the value of `IPADDR` to the old servers IP address in `/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0`.
2. In cloud.jetserver.net, remove the IP address from the old server:
    - *[Old Server Name] -> NETWORKS -> Actions -> Remove IP: 1.2.3.4*
    - *[New Server Name] -> NETWORKS -> Actions -> Add IP Address -> Add Manually* and add the old servers IP address
    - *[New Server Name] -> NETWORKS -> Actions -> Remove IP: [Temp servers IP]*
3. In **WHM** (`whmlogin` in the command line) go to *Server Configuration -> Basic WebHost Manager® Setup*, under *Basic Config* change the IPv4 address to the old servers ip.
4. Go to *IP Functions -> IP Migration Wizard* and add the old ip address in the text box, then press **Continue**, (Fill the next form the same) continue with the Wizard.

---

## Change OMC UUID

1. In cloud.jetserver.net, go to *[New Server Name] -> OVERVIEW* then copy the **Server ID** (For example: 554db793-a9fe-5028-6ce6-6a076a1easds)
2. In jetclients.co.il/mgmt/ go to the clients product and scroll down to **OMC UUID** then overwrite it with the newly found **Server ID**.

2. In the new servers command line, overwrite the `/usr/local/lsws/conf/serial.no` file.
3. Remove the `/usr/local/lsws/conf/license.key` file.
4. Run `/usr/local/lsws/bin/lshttpd -ra`.
5. In WHM, Go to *Plugins -> ListSpeed Web Server* verify that everything is allright and cPanel is using LiteSpeed (Use Switch To LiteSpeed)

## Replace old *.jetserver.net wildcard SSL certificate with cpanel AutoSSL certificate

Run:
```bash
whmapi1 reset_service_ssl_certificate service=cpanel
whmapi1 reset_service_ssl_certificate service=ftp
whmapi1 reset_service_ssl_certificate service=dovecot
whmapi1 reset_service_ssl_certificate service=exim
/scripts/restartsrv_cpsrvd
/usr/local/cpanel/bin/checkallsslcerts --allow-retry --verbose
/usr/local/cpanel/cpkeyclt
/scripts/restartsrv_cpsrvd
```

If this works, run:
```bash
/scripts/autorepair purge_hostname_cert_csrs
```

If this does not work as well use workaround:

1. Move hostname_history.json out of the way.
```bash
mv /var/cpanel/hostname_history.json{,.$( date +%Y%m%d )}
```
2. Move hostname_cert_csrs out of the way.
```bash
mv /var/cpanel/hostname_cert_csrs{,.$( date +%Y%m%d )}
```
3. Run the checkallsslcerts script to order a new certificate.
```bash
/usr/local/cpanel/bin/checkallsslcerts
```

Another solution if you got errors like:

> The system failed to validate domain control for the domain “autodiscover.israel140.jetserver.net” using the “DNS” DCV method: 400 urn:ietf:params:acme:erro
r:dns (There was a problem with a DNS query) (DNS problem: NXDOMAIN looking up TXT for _acme-challenge.autodiscover.israel140.jetserver.net - check that a D
NS record exists for this domain)

Run:
```bash
whmapi1 adddns domain=your.server's.hostname ip=IP
```

And then:
```bash
/usr/local/cpanel/bin/checkallsslcerts
```
