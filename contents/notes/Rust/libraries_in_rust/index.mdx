title: Libraries in Rust
description: "By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it brings into the scope of every program."

To bring a library *into scope* we'll have to use the `use` statement, .e.g:

```rust
use <LIBRARY_NAME>;
```

At the begging of the file.

This would *bring into scope* only the items that are included in the **prelude**, and if for example I would like to *bring into scope* libraries that are not in the **prelude** I would have to call them like this:

```rust
use <LIBRARY_NAME>::<ITEM_NAME>;
```

A good example for this would be the **std** library, when I want to use *input/output*

operations I would have to call a library outside of the **prelude** named **io**, and it looks like this:

```rust
use std::io;
```

Now, for instance I can take input from users:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);
}
```
