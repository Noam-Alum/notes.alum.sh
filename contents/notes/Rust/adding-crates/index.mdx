title: "Adding crates"
description: "We can add dependencies to Rust via Cargo, by simply modifying the cargo.toml file in our project."

> Dependencies in Rust are called **crates**.

For this sake lets add the **[rand](https://crates.io/crates/rand)** crate:

cargo.toml:

```
[dependencies]
rand = "0.8.5"
```

After saving the changes, we can run `cargo build` to fetch the crates from [crates.io](https://crates.io/) and finally save the matching versions for the respective crate in the *cargo.lock* file.

<Note type="note" title="tip">
  You can update crates versioning by simply running:
  ```bash
  cargo update
  ```
  In the project directory
</Note>

Now that we have the **rand** crate installed and ready to use, we can bring it to scope in our code like this:

```rust
use rand::Rng; // Our library
use std::io;
```

> Notice that we brought to scope the **Rng** trait. (Which was not in the prelude)

And we can write a simple guessing game:

```rust
use std::io;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let number :i32 = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(0..=10 );

    let mut guess_string :String = String::new();
    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess_string)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    // Convert to i32
    let guess :i32 = guess_string.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");

    if number == guess {
        println!("You guessed the secret number.");
    } else {
        println!("{} is not the secret number ({}).", guess, number);
    }
}
```

Lets explain this line in the code:

```rust
let number :i32 = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(0..=10 );
```

<Stepper>
  <StepperItem title="Initiating a variable">
    First we initiate an *i32* integer variable using `:i32` after variable declaration
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Getting a random number">
    Then we call the **thread_rng** function from the **rand** library, that would retrieve a random number using complex calculations based on per system bases ensuring a random number is returned.
  </StepperItem> 
  <StepperItem title="Setting the range">
    Now that we have a random number we can set the range as follows:
    ```rust
    gen_range(<START>..=<END>);
    ```
    For example:
    ```rust
    gen_range(0..=10);
    ```
  </StepperItem> 
 </Stepper>


Another *complex-ish* line can be this line:

```rust
let guess :i32 = guess_string.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");
```

As we know we cant take `i32` variables from the `stdin` function, we can only take strings, to *type cast* from **String** to **int** we need to do a couple of things:

1. Trim the data to remove any leading/trailing white-space. (`.trim()`)

2. Parse the data to convert the string to an integer. (`.parse()`)

3. Add error handling in case user input was not a digit. (`.expect`)
