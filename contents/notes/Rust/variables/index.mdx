title: Handling variables
---

By default variables in **Rust** are *immutable*, meaning you cannot change them (like constants), to make a variable mutable we need to use the `mut` statement.

<Note type="note">
To create a new variable we use the `let` statement.
</Note>

For instance:

```rust
let apples = 5; // immutable
mut let peers = 5; //mutable
```

### Creating empty strings

To create a string we need to *bring into scope* the **std** library, we can do that by simply adding:

```rust
use std;
```

To the top of out script.

Next we need to declare a variable, and assign to it an instance of a `String`, using the **String** library (its in the **prelude**):

```rust
let mute guess = String::new();
```

<Note type="note" title="FYI">
`String` is a **string** type that is growable; [More on String](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html).
