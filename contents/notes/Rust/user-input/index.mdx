title: "Handeling user input"
description: "We can get UI via the stdin function from the io module, and it looks something like this:"
---

```rust
io::stdin()
    .read_line(&mut guess)
```

If lets say this failed we can send an error message via  `.expect` :

```rust
io::stdin()
    .read_line(&mut guess)
    .expect("Failed to read line");
```

---

Example program:

```rust
use std::io;

fn main() {
    println!("Guess the number!");

    println!("Please input your guess.");

    let mut guess = String::new();

    io::stdin()
        .read_line(&mut guess)
        .expect("Failed to read line");

    println!("You guessed: {}", guess);
}
```
