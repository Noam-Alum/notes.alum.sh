# Distance vector VS Link state

> Routing is the proccess of one transmiting data from one node to another.

## Distance vector

Distance vector is an algorithm that changes based on its neigbors, a given router routing table is shared to other routers that are **directly connected** and they update their local table periodically.

## Link state

Link state is a **dynamic** routing algorithm where every router keeps information on the whole network, routers flood the entier network with their link-state information across the entier network, making sure that all routers have an updated view on the network.

## Difference

| **Distance Vector Routing**                                                            | **Link State Routing**                                                              |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bandwidth required is less due to local sharing, small packets and no flooding.        | Bandwidth required is more due to flooding and sending of large link state packets. |
| Based on local knowledge, since it updates table based on information from neighbours. | Based on global knowledge, it have knowledge about entire network.                  |
| Make use of Bellman Ford Algorithm.                                                    | Make use of Dijakstraâ€™s algorithm.                                                  |
| Traffic is less.                                                                       | Traffic is more.                                                                    |
| Converges slowly i.e, good news spread fast and bad news spread slowly.                | Converges faster.                                                                   |
| Count of infinity problem.                                                             | No count of infinity problem.                                                       |
| Persistent looping problem i.e, loop will be there forever.                            | No persistent loops, only transient loops.                                          |
| Practical implementation is RIP and IGRP.                                              | Practical implementation is OSPF and ISIS.                                          |
