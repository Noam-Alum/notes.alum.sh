  <StepperItem title="Scan WordFence QR code">
    I installed [WordFence](https://www.wordfence.com/) becaue I wanted to improve the websites security, one of the features given with the free version of WordFence is [2FA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication), this step is crucial to login to our website.
    <Note type="note" title="Dont know what to do with the QR code? ">
      I recommend using [Google Authenticator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605) as its very easy to use.

  <StepperItem title="Obtain the login URL">
    Another free feature of WordFence is *custom login url*, hence you would have to ask someone how already knows the url for it. (e.g. Noam or Shay)
  </StepperItem>
  <StepperItem title="Login">
    After entering the *login url* you should get a page simular to this:
    ![WordPress login page](/Harel/website/how-to-login/1.png)
    Enter the username and password, the you should be asked for the 2FA code:
    ![WordPress 2FA](/Harel/website/how-to-login/2.png)
    Enter the code from your authenticator app, and your good to go!
