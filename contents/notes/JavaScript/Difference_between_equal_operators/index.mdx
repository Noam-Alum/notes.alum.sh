# Difference Between == & === in JavaScript

Equality operators in JavaScript (double equals (**==**) and triple equals (**===**) ) are used to compare two values yet both operators are used for a different purpose:

- **== :** Converts the values to the same data type and then try to compare them.
  
- **=== :** Compares the value and the datatype.
  



**For example:**

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = "5";

// Double equals
if (x == y) {
    console.log("Equals");
} else {
    console.log("Not equal");
}

// Tripple equalts
if (x === y) {
    console.log("Equals");
} else {
    console.log("Not equal");
}
```

**Would result in:**

```text
Equals // Double equals
Not equal // Tripple equals
```

**Breakdown:**

1. `x` is declared with the value of 5 **as an integer**.
  
2. `y` is declared with the value of "5" **as a string**.
  
3. We check if `x == y` (With double quotes), this effectively changes y from a string to an integer and then checks if the values are equal (Thus making the result **True**).
  
  ```text
  // The first output
  Equals
  ```
  
4. We check if `x === y` (With tipple quotes), this compares both the **values** and the **data types**, meaning if we try to compare a string to an int it would result in **False**.
  
  ```text
  // The second output
  Not equal
  ```
