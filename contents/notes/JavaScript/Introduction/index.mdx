# Introduction to javascript

JavaScript is an interpreted language primarily executed by the V8 engine and supports both **synchronous** and **asynchronous** execution, it is extensively used in web browsers and server environments like Node.js.

> - **Synchronous:** Execution waits for a task to complete before moving on to the next.
> - **Asynchronous:** Allows other tasks to proceed while waiting for a response.

When working with JavaScript objects such as arrays, we create instances of these objects. These instances can utilize methods and properties defined for their types.

For example, an array has a `length` property that returns the number of elements in the array.

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(numbers.length); // Outputs: 5
```

> **Tip:** Use `const` to declare arrays and other data structures to avoid accidental reassignment.

### Static and Instance Methods

A function is considered *static* if it does not rely on instance-specific data. Static methods belong to the class itself rather than any specific instance. Hereâ€™s an example:

```javascript
// Instance method
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(numbers.length); // Instance method used on array

// Static method
console.log(Math.floor(2.45)); // Static method used on Math class
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Functions:** Use camelCase, e.g., `calculateTotal()`.
- **Classes:** Use PascalCase (also known as UpperCamelCase), e.g., `UserAccount`.
- **Variables:** Use camelCase, e.g., `totalAmount`.

These conventions help in maintaining consistency and readability in JavaScript code.
